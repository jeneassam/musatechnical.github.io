	<p>A research is a plan of the proposed research work. In research, the idea of research findings and the conclusions presented in the paper are of primary importance. The value and importance of the matter presented depends upon an orderly presentation, well documented, and free of the mechanical flaws. Having specified the objectives of the survey and the units of analysis, the researcher has several different designs to choose. Thus specified research design is important for the research matter.
	In this study we shall discuss the various aspects of research design such as: the meaning and definition, needs for research design, features, functions, types, purpose, basic survey design, kinds and other principles.A research is a plan of the proposed research work.
